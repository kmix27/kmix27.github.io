### Metis clock = 79.78 hours ###

>What a week.  I was excited walking into this, but I can confidently say that has only increased.  As a relatively new blogger,  it's not really a format that I'm entierly comftorble with yet, however part of the reaseon I started this whole adventure was to shake up my comfort zone,  so why not here too!

>The coursework has been progressing comftorbly.  My Python at the beginning of the pre-work I would rate at a slightly advanced beginner,  and I think that was just enough.  The first week has concentrated mostly on getting everyone on the same level with some of the key tools, namely Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib, Git / GitHub, and the command line to name a few.  None of these were foreign to me to begin with, so working through assignments hasen't been a stretch.  I'm really glad that I took the time beforehand to read a good portion of Wes McKinney's book: [Python for Data Analysis][pfda], I really can't say enough about that book.  The Pandas documentation is pretty darn good all things said,  but having some more explicet and involved examples has really been helpful.  I know that it will continue to come in handy.

>The proposition of a project due at the end of the first week was both exciting and daunting.  I actually really appreciated the pace, there wasn't really much of a ramp up,  it was more an 'ok, now go'.  It gets you in the right mindset,  and it gives you a taste of reality.  I can dream, and often my vision of what I want to create is quite ambitious. I particularly liked the short turnaround on this first project because it forced me to reconcile my dreams of what could be done with what's realistic given the constraints.  This method of thinking is a way of life within industry, so I really like how that little taste of reality was emphasized directly out of the gates.  It sets a good pace.  

>The projects data set was turnstile data from the MTA of New York,  and it was an exercise in several things,  Among them:

+ Data wrangling - MTA data is nasty on a good day
+ Pitching a project - communication is key,  that was a focus.
+ Visualization - Hand in hand with communication
+ Brainstorming, and the decision making process within a group.
+ Delegation
+ Presentation of something useful in such a way to not put your audience to sleep
