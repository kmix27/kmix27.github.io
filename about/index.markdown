**Kyle Mix** 
I'm a data scientist living and working in San Francisco with a background in e-commerce fraud prevention.  I'm Endlessly curious, effortlessly creative, and uncannily passionate.  Maker.  I Love good design, elegent solutions to complex problems, and eating breakfast in diners.  Hopefully you'll enjoy my musings on data science and related topics, and really anything else that catches my fancy.  Available for any interesting opportunity that comes along.
