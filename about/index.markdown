**Kyle Mix**  
I'm a data scientist living and working in San Francisco with a background in e-commerce fraud prevention.  I'm endlessly curious, effortlessly creative, and uncannily passionate.  Maker since I had control of motor functions.  
**I love** good design, elegant solutions to complex problems, and eating breakfast in diners.  Hopefully you'll enjoy my musings on data science and related topics, and really anything else that catches my fancy.  Available for any interesting opportunity that comes along.  My #1 question is this:  
How can I leverage my skills to solve the problems you face?  
Eminently employable. **ACT FAST!**
